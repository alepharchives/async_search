In these cases, comments can and should be used to not only explain why you have such optimizations, but what the code is doing. A good rule of thumb would be to have someone else (or multiple other people) familiar with the implementation language and project look at your code - if they can't understand both the why and the how, then you should comment both the why and the how.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, what's not clear in the code is why you have done something. If you take an approach that might not be obvious to others, you should have a comment that explains why you made the decisions that you did. I would suspect that you might not even realize that a comment is needed until after something like a code review, where people want to know why you did X instead of Y - you can capture your answer in the code for everyone else who looks at it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most important thing, though, is to change your comments when you change your code.

From there the term migrated into military slang, where it merged with FUBAR.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Bar&quot; as the second term in the series may have developed in electronics, where a digital signal which is considered &quot;on&quot; with a negative or zero-voltage condition is identified with a horizontal bar over the signal label; the notation for an inverted signal foo would then be pronounced &quot;foo bar&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="11" LastActivityDate="2010-09-01T21:58:52.427" />

Bill Holman, the author of the strip, filled it with odd jokes and personal contrivances, including other nonsense phrases such as “Notary Sojac” and “1506 nix nix”. The word “foo” frequently appeared on license plates of cars, in nonsense sayings in the background of some frames (such as “He who foos last foos best” or “Many smoke but foo men chew”), and Holman had Smokey say “Where there's foo, there's fire”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8" LastActivityDate="2010-09-01T21:59:52.707" />

I spent some time in middle school messing around with the map editors for Half-Life, Max Payne and Unreal Tournament and although I wasn't particularly talented at designing &lt;em&gt;pretty&lt;/em&gt; things, I really enjoyed creating the logical mechanics of interactive play- elevators, light switches, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I brought my interests to some friends on IRC and I had this grand idea to launch a community-driven website about game mod development. At first I worked with a friend who did the design, HTML, and some PHP work on my behalf, but gradually I began to want more and more from the project. I picked up a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/076450214X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;HTML for Dummies&lt;/a&gt; circa 2000, &lt;em&gt;Macromedia&lt;/em&gt; DreamWeaver (3, I think), and a few really awesome books about PHP. I started to fiddle my way through all of these new topics in front of me and the website I had come up with gradually took shape. As the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;spaghetti bowl&lt;/a&gt; of functionality that was ModDev.net took shape I became progressively more interested in web development than I was in game development. The now-defunct ModDev.net was my crash course into programming in the form of something that probably resembled &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Katamari Damacy&lt;/a&gt;, but as I built and maintained it, I continuously branched out into side projects and freelance work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did freelance PHP work from about 9th grade to 11th, but my dedication to programming waned in favor of a few MMORPGS which stole my soul. At the end of high school I hadn't done much programming for a while, and I had no idea where I was going to college. I happened upon a school in Utah called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neumont.edu/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Neumont&lt;/a&gt;; they offer a very focused 2.5 year bachelor program in computer science, namely software engineering. I checked the school out and I was impressed immediately. I applied and was accepted. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At school we focused on C# and Java primarily. While I was attending (the program is a little different now) we had the option to focus on one over the other and also to take them in the order we chose. I started out with C# and although object-oriented programming was vaguely familiar to me from my PHP days (I never really &lt;em&gt;got it&lt;/em&gt; then), I had no problems picking it up and getting my hands dirty. After a couple of semesters of C#, I tried Java- much to my disdain. I approached Java with a predetermined hatred stemming from all of my prior negative experiences with &lt;em&gt;horrible&lt;/em&gt; Java applications in the past; sure enough &lt;a href=&quot;http://zef.me/878/why-java-sucks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the language sucks&lt;/a&gt; too.Neumont organizes internships for its students as part of finishing the curriculum, so in my last two semesters I found myself working for a medical software company building C# applications, and a small game development company working on an iPhone game (which never saw fruition).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After completing the degree program at Neumont in just 2.5 years, I began hunting for jobs in the area. It took me about 3 months of searching, but I found myself in a salaried position at a tiny company building ASP.NET websites for small businesses. I have a lot of freedom to work at my own pace and learn new things because I always work alone. For 22 years old, I could definitely do worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey look, I just wrote an essay...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="13" LastActivityDate="2010-09-02T01:26:23.247" CommunityOwnedDate="2011-02-13T14:40:48.817" CommentCount="1" />

All things static present real, tangible problems when you try to do Unit Testing because they represent dead ends in your code that cannot be mocked or stubbed.

Another worry is often related to your expected salary in relation to the job posting.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately employers are looking to score the biggest bang for their buck and all too often, they associate experience and maturity with &quot;old&quot; and figure that they'll go with someone younger and rougher around the edges but they figure they can train them for cheaper and keep them longer than they can someone with more experience and maturity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my current team our Scrum Master and Team Leader is a guy who is in his fifties and he is invaluable in smoothing out rough spots and dealing with our upper management.

Usually any variable declaration looks like a tuple of: &lt;code&gt;type varname;&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;Function pointer declarations on the other hand look like a declaration of the function with * before the function name. I can accept this as a description of a pointer type, but in C this declares both the type and the name of a variable of that type. This looks inconsistent to me because type declarations are otherwise distinct from variable declarations. &lt;code&gt;struct myStruct{int X; int Y;}&lt;/code&gt; only defines a type, it does not define a variable named &lt;code&gt;myStruct&lt;/code&gt;.

Typing system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The number one feature that I would want in a language is static typing with &lt;em&gt;optional&lt;/em&gt; dynamic typing. The reason is that static typing allows you to a) catch errors early rather than late and b) most code is implicitly statically typed, whether or not the language makes the distinction. However, there are several use-cases where dynamic typing is extremely useful. For example, when reading data from a file, you often have fields of varying types, and dynamic typing makes heterogeneous containers easy. So, my ideal language would have something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//variable declarations&#xA;int anInt = 42 //anInt is now irrevocably an integer and assigning another type to it is an error&#xA;vartype aVariable = 42 //aVariable is currently an integer, but any type can be assigned to it in the future&#xA;&#xA;//function definitions&#xA;int countElements(Collection c) {return c.count();} //c HAS to be a collection, since countElements doesn't make sense otherwise&#xA;void addToCollection(Collection&amp;amp; c, vartype v) {c.append(v)} //c is passed by reference here&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Compiled vs. Interpreted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd like the language to be either compiled ahead of time, or JIT compiled, but not purely interpreted, speed being the reason. This ties in to point &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;, since an optimising compiler/jitter will have a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier time optimising statically typed code, and dynamically typed code could simply be left as-is. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Closures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The language must support functional programming constructs, and functions should be first-class objects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Object-oriented&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The language should allow you to write object-oriented code, but simple imperative code should be allowed too. i.e., it should be possible to write a hello world program like so:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int main(string&amp;lt;&amp;gt; args=null){printf(&quot;hello, world&quot;); return 0;} //this code also demonstrates two other features, default arguments for functions (not explained further) and immutable lists like string&amp;lt;&amp;gt; (see 6. Built-in datatypes)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Namespaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Namespaces are a good thing. Very little stuff should go into the global namespace. But if you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; put stuff in the global namespace, you can (ala C++).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Built-in datatypes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The language must have, as built-in datatypes, the following constructs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; datatype or types. If there is only one &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; type, it should have unlimited range. If there are more, there should be implicit upcasting into the &lt;em&gt;smallest&lt;/em&gt; type capable of holding the result of a computation, with the unlimited range type being the largest.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A single built-in binary &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; type, which is equivalent to an IEEE 754 &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A mutable &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; type which is implemented as either a doubly linked list or a block of contiguous memory holding pointers to each element&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An immutable &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; type that acts like an array but whose size cannot be changed after creation&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mutable and immutable &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; types, with the default being immutable.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt; type that is mutable, and holds immutable keys and mutable and/or immutable values.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The built-in collection types should be homogeneous typed by default, but can be &lt;code&gt;vartype&lt;/code&gt;d if required&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; type&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt; type that can be assigned to a variable of any type.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mutable and immutable &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; types&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;code&gt;decimal&lt;/code&gt; type which implements decimal floating point variables&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;code&gt;fixed&lt;/code&gt; type, that implements a fixed-point number&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;decimal&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fixed&lt;/code&gt; types should share the &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; same public interface (either via inheritance or duck typing), allowing them to be transparently passed to and returned from functions. The parent type could be called &lt;code&gt;real&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Call by value and by reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should be able to call functions by both value and reference, with the default being value (i.e., a copy of the argument is made and operated upon in the function).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Pointers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The language should have pointers and allow pointer arithmetic. Pointers can only be statically typed (to avoid the nightmare that is a &lt;code&gt;void*&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;code&gt;vartype&lt;/code&gt; pointers are explicitly disallowed. Having pointers and pointer arithmetic allows the language to be seriously used as a systems programming language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Inline assembly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In connection with &lt;strong&gt;8.&lt;/strong&gt;, The language should allow inline assembly language code for those situations where it is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Safety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The language should be mostly safe to use, supporting exception handling etc. Pointer arithmetic and inline assembly can be relegated to portions of the code explicitly marked as unsafe. Unsafe code is allowed, but strongly discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Undefined behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The language standard should specify how the program is to behave under all circumstances &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; in code explicitly marked unsafe, i.e., there should be no undefined behaviour outside of unsafe blocks. This allows the language to be used as a viable application development language, while still allowing you to say, write an OS in it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's all I can think of at the moment, but I'll edit/update the post as I think of more things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="61" LastEditorUserId="61" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-09-24T13:11:04.500" LastActivityDate="2010-09-24T13:11:04.500" CommentCount="11" />

Yes, people need an underlying knowledge of the technologies and theories (the same colleague said &quot;build tools change over the years, but polymorphism will always be polymorphism&quot;) but it should be possible to teach marketable skills alongside the theory. For example, submit coursework using svn. Get students to setup CI for all of their coursework. These are skills that take about a year to learn and perfect when starting a new job but could be perfected over 3-4 years of a computer science degree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question hidden in that rant is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Did your computer science degree set you up for your first job or did you need 1-2 years of experience to learn the basic skills of a programmer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="154" LastActivityDate="2010-09-16T03:40:13.523" Title="Do you think Computer Science degrees are suitable for getting a job in the modern job market?"

I have prepared &lt;a href=&quot;http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/661/how-do-you-break-and-indent-long-lines&quot;&gt;a question&lt;/a&gt; for the rules, but i wanted to collect the best examples first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please not break your long line, at least not much. just break it as much so that it is readable in this website. You can break your long line to your hearts content in &lt;a href=&quot;http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/661/how-do-you-break-and-indent-long-lines&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; once we have a good set of example lines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One example per answer please.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="116" LastEditorUserId="666" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-10-02T15:53:38.053" LastActivityDate="2010-10-02T15:53:38.053" Title="Writing a style guide, what are the best examples for breaking long lines?"

Electives would include topics such as computational sciences (biology, physics, chemistry), machine learning, computer vision, image processing, artificial intelligence, design of programming languages, compiler design, security (cryptography as as example of an important topic), and operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Software engineering should include the same mathematical background - discrete mathematics, calculus (at least single variable), and statistics. Other courses should be requirements engineering, architecture, design, testing, process, software usability/HCI, and formal methods. An overview of computer engineering (hardware, digital logic, digital circuits, etc) and computer science (automata theory, formal languages) should be required. There should also be room for a sequence of mathematics, computer science, and or computer engineering electives as computer science is the foundation of software engineering (in the same manner that physics is the foundation of mechanical engineering) and computer engineering is relevant to anyone developing software on low-level systems such as microcontrollers. Software engineering electives should include different types of software systems - distributed, concurrent, enterprise, web, embedded, real-time, along with additional courses on specific process models and methodologies (agile, CMMI).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have no experience with computer engineering, so I can't comment on that. I would suspect that such a program would focus on hardware, low-level programming (assembly, C, maybe C++), embedded systems, and computer architectures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, all programs should have room for a number of liberal arts and free electives. I feel that these, in most  cases, should be used for communication, business, and social science (psychology, sociology, ethics) courses.

At heart, a computer is going to have some sort of instructions that look analogous to this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mv r0, r1  #copy r1 to r0&#xA;stw r0, 0xDEADBEEF #Store r0 in 0xDEADBEEF. Nom.&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These operations are mutating state. So there's a paradigm impedance mismatch going on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another part of the issue with immutability is that typically, things don't just disappear and reappear in a new form when their state changes. When your state changes from Single to Married, you don't suddenly have a new instance of You come into being. So there is a &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; mismatch, wherein the problem and solution domain don't really fit immutability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, immutability does solve some issues that come up, notably issues of parallel read/write access. But it solves them by going around the problem. Sometimes that works. Other times, it doesn't. And still, you have the impedance mismatch between immutability and reality. So I don't like immutability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this answers the responses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="148" LastEditorUserId="148" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-09-20T19:39:15.113" LastActivityDate="2010-09-20T19:39:15.113" CommunityOwnedDate="2010-09-20T19:39:15.113" CommentCount="16" />

A lake stagnates. There’s&#xA;  no energy or impetus to change. The&#xA;  same is true of groups that stagnate.&#xA;  They cultivate mediocrity and&#xA;  complacency; they abhor risk. A river&#xA;  is always running and changing with&#xA;  lots of great energy. You want a&#xA;  river.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A river depends on the flow of water,&#xA;  and your team depends on the flow of&#xA;  people and information. You can think&#xA;  of the people divided into three&#xA;  groups: new blood, new leaders, and&#xA;  elders ready for a new challenge.&#xA;  Here’s how those groups should balance&#xA;  and flow:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest group should be the new blood. Not all of them will become&#xA;  technical or organizational leaders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you’ll have more new leaders than elders, sometimes the&#xA;  reverse, but ideally you should&#xA;  maintain a balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For flow, you want a steady stream of new blood becoming your new&#xA;  leaders, and new leaders becoming&#xA;  elders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to flow is new blood coming in and elders moving out. For this to&#xA;  work, you WANT your elders to transfer&#xA;  before they clog the stream and&#xA;  disrupt the flow of opportunitiesfor&#xA;  others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Not all technologies flow at the same&#xA;  rate. Central engines, like the&#xA;  Windows kernel, flow slowly, while&#xA;  web-based services, like MSN Search,&#xA;  flow quickly. You need to adjust for&#xA;  your situation, but even the most&#xA;  conservative technologies do change&#xA;  and flow. How do you successfully&#xA;  encourage and maintain a healthy flow?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep a constant supply of new people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instill information sharing as a way of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shape the organization and roles to create growth opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find new challenges for your elders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="162" LastActivityDate="2010-09-03T20:32:37.813" CommentCount="6" />

You can be a programmer as a CIS and you can be a IT person as a CSE but I think with CSE I am more prepared for programming (I did CSE software specialization) and as a CIS you are more prepared for desktop support. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is my conclusion anyway, take it or leave it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of recruiters is depends on the job and the person.  A friend of mine recently finished his CSE degree and he has had a desktop support job as a student and is considering pursuing desktop support because he said he likes it.  I know based that a CSE will be more prepared to solve technical problems in the general sense due to the underlying Engineering experience.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, I interviewed for a position at a local company looking to hire their first IT person and hope to cut back on 3rd part consulting costs but I felt a CIS would be better prepared for the job and frankly more interested.  The job presented to me no technical problems, but perhaps a CIS would thrive in that position where you are a technical analyst, computer/IT handy man.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I know from OSU at least most CSE finish in 5 years (not the usual 4 years everyone claims an undergrad program should be) and CIS majors finish in 4 years (not the usual 5 years a OSU Engineering program will take).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Me, personally, I like to program and solve technical problems and that is what defines me as a CSE, not my degree itself.

Succinct syntax is a very small factor: a much more important one is that the most commonly required functionality is easily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for something more subjective, I’d say &lt;em&gt;how fun it is&lt;/em&gt;.

This measure takes into account that different people have different preferences on how to use things, so the “best” programming language will be the one that is most appealing to the widest range of programmers. However, you might need to consider not just the programming language and API here, but also the environment (IDE), which is of course what the programmer actually interacts with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="147" LastActivityDate="2010-09-04T19:38:40.217" CommentCount="3" />

Because SVN was much easier for a single developer or small team, and git (specifically msysgit) left me with a bad taste in my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was interning at a small shop, I was introduced to git on Windows. I immediately noticed the amount of work it took to get it to work with Github. First, I had to generate a ssh private key, paste the public key in Github, then bring up pageant and open my private key each time I wanted to push, which was extremely annoying. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I never really liked that I was pulling down the entire repository. I will admit that I never worked with anything huge, but I would be afraid to download KDE's repository in Git if the entire repo and its revisions are on my HD. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there was the confusing process to make a commit. TMK, I had to first &quot;stage&quot; all the files I wanted to commit (which sucked when you had many many files, took me a while to find the manual command to stage everything), then do the commit, then push to the main repo (why is that a separate operation?!).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You also had the not(!) very helpful commit data. Oh look, this is commit 14f74433245ae17aeeaa part of tree 2167a4934d0a4a7db0de and parent d7042abb4821d3faf600. The hell does that mean? I should be able to figure out things pretty quickly and not have to consult some weird documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of documentation, at least when I was using it, it seemed everything was in linux man file format, IE confusing and useless to me. I rarely could find much help in the docs and simply resorted to google.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And with commits, the one thing that I didn't like was the lack of version numbers. Now I know that this is because of the design of git, but any software needs a version number. I still remember the marker commits that would pop up saying &quot;Changed version to 1.8.6&quot; or something similar, but you still couldn't do build numbers. To me having the version be 1.8.6.5164 (last part is revision number) tells me a lot more than simply 1.8.6 and a note saying that something minor changed, try it&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting software specific, the base program on Windows is msysgit, which is a terrible interface. It locked up on me a few times, had a horrible interface, and CLI-GUI integration was iffy at best. The command line junkies around me hated the gui even more. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now lets look at SVN. And since I'm on Windows and have a google account, specifically TortoiseSVN and Google Code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, complete shell integration to do everything on the repository (and for you linux people, RabbitVCS does the same thing), no main GUI needed. Getting a repository is easy as a checkout, no SSH needed (can't remember if Github required SSH for pulls), and no entire repo + all past commits sitting on your HD.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Committing is extremal easy, mainly because no SSH or staging is required. You simply check all the files you want using the very helpful select all option that in my msysgit version wasn't available, type in a commit message, and hit commit. Google Code then asks you for your login information (which most clients store), and your done. Simple, easy, and no SSH&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Version numbers? With some easy code, you can add a version number and a commit number to all checkouts, which makes things so much easier. You also get usable version numbers that actually show a change, eg 1.8.6.5165 is newer than 1.8.6.5164. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Documentation? Well, its hard to say. Tortoise is documented, but I haven't actually referred to the official documentation in such a long time that I can't judge. Reading a simple intro guide was enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Merging is something else I can't compare. I had to do it once in Git when somebody else committed a change to a file I was working on, but never in SVN. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which one would I recommend? Well in large teams, git does have its advantages, mainly in its non-linear development cycle. In another project I saw 4 programmers start in separate branches, then merge all the code in very strange ways that somehow morphed into the final master branch. Github and msysgit had a really nice visualization tool for the whole project that I really liked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For single developer or small team projects, SVN would be the best since most of Gits features aren't used and your only getting its negative parts.

The macro will happily attempt to compare &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; including pointers or strings, which might compile, but is almost certainly not what you wanted. On the other hand, if you made macros type-safe, they offer no benefits or convenience over overloaded functions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Macros used to specify shortcuts to often-used elements. &lt;code&gt;#define p printf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is easily replaced by a function &lt;code&gt;p()&lt;/code&gt; that does the same thing.

This has several consequences:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compiler has no way of checking that a macro is semantically closed, i.e. that it represents a “unit of meaning” like a function does. (Consider &lt;code&gt;#define TWO 1+1&lt;/code&gt; — what does &lt;code&gt;TWO*TWO&lt;/code&gt; equal? 3.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macros are not typed like functions are. The compiler cannot check that the parameters and return type make sense. It can only check the expanded expression that uses the macro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the code doesn’t compile, the compiler has no way of knowing whether the error is in the macro itself or the place where the macro is used. The compiler will either report the wrong place half of the time, or it has to report both even though one of them is probably fine. (Consider &lt;code&gt;#define min(x,y) (((x)&amp;lt;(y))?(x):(y))&lt;/code&gt;: What should the compiler do if the types of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; don’t match or don’t implement &lt;code&gt;operator&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automated tools cannot work with them in semantically useful ways. In particular, you can’t have things like IntelliSense for macros that work like functions but expand to an expression. (Again, the &lt;code&gt;min&lt;/code&gt; example.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The side-effects of a macro are not as explicit as they are with functions, causing potential confusion for the programmer. (Consider again the &lt;code&gt;min&lt;/code&gt; example: in a function call, you know that the expression for &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is evaluated only once, but here you can’t know without looking at the macro.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like I said, these are all consequences of the fact that macros are lexical.

Look at existing solutions that this project will replace, either that the customer is using or that exist in the market place.  From there, write it all down in a non-technical language as you can- a good reqs doc should describe what's to be done but not how to do it.  Then discuss this doc with the customer and iterate until they agree with it.  This step can be less formal for smaller projects (possibly even entirely verbal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start making technical decisions.

There is some risk in this approach as, unlike working via a limited company, you will not be protected by limited liability.  That means that if you get into a dispute with your client and they sue you, your personal assets (e.g. your house) are at risk.  For this reason, if you go down this route, you really should get professional indemnity insurance (in fact, clients may refuse to deal with you if you don't have this).

For both the self-employed route and the limited company you need to be aware of the implications of the IR35 legislation and, if you are turning over any serious money, you'll need to register for VAT.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bytestart.co.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ByteStart&lt;/a&gt; website has several articles about the various options for becoming self-employed, incorporating a company, etc., and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.contractoruk.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Contractor UK&lt;/a&gt; has specific advice for IT contractors.

It meant I was able to rest the heel of my palm on the back of the mouse, effectively palm-gripping it even when at rest.
